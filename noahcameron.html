     <h2>LOGS</h2>
    <h5>June 13, 2020</h5>
    <p>I finally know what I have to do.</p>
    <h5>June 18, 2020</h5>
    <p>Jasper thinks I'm acting off. Made a report about it and everything. But my mind is more clear then it's ever been.</p>
    <h5>June 24, 2020</h5>
    <p>Hana Stone let the chance of a lifetime with Whisper slip through her fingers. I'm not going to make the same mistakes as her.</p>
    <h5>July 1, 2020</h5>
    <p>Now even Hana thinks I'm acting off. Why don't they realise? They're acting just like her.</p>
    <h5>July 4, 2020</h5>
    <p>Vixen's getting too close. But I was too sloppy. I think Hana is starting to put pieces together. I can only hope she sees the same thing I do.</p>
    <h5>July 9, 2020</h5>
    <p>She didn't. Thankfully, I opened Robert's mind, and made him deal with her for me.</p>
    <h5>July 30, 2020</h5>
    <p>I should be thankfully Hana being paranoid in the past has allowed me to peer into messages I wouldn't have used to. Vixen and Maya are getting too close. I couldn't open their minds.</p>
    <h5>August 6, 2020</h5>
    <p>Maya has been dealt with.</p>
    <h5>August 14, 2020</h5>
    <p>Vixen has been dealt with.</p>
    <h5>August 22, 2020</h5>
    <p>I can finally spread the joy that is Whisper all around the country. Soon, the world. This effort will not have been for nothing. Ash disagreed. They will be dealt with.</p>
    <h5>August 25, 2020</h5>
    <p>Ash has been dealt with.</p>
    <h5>August 29, 2020</h5>
    <p>Hana is back, trying to get involved with issues that aren't hers to deal with. I should of dealt with her personally.</p>
    <h5>September 6, 2020</h5>
    <p>Hana's finally contacted me. Something big is about to happen.</p>
