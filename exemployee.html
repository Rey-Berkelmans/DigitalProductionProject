    <p>On the ninth of July, Hana Stone was let go from Veles Laboratory due to behavioural issues and harassment towards other staff. Since then, Hana Stone has been spreading inappropriate and false rumours regarding the research conducted within Veles Laboratory.</p>
    <p>Veles Laboratory is making a statement to assure that all these rumours are the lies of a upset ex-employee, and have no bearing in reality.</p>
